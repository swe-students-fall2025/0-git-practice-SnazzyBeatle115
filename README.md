## Article Commentary
I think this article is pretty interesting because it discusses the inclusion of AI in game development. Roblox recently announced at their Roblox Developers Conference some new tools to help developers create UGC. Specifically, they invested in AI powered development tools to make development easier and more accessible. Additionally, they are increasing the rate at which developers can monetize. The purpose of the article is to make creators feel supported. Roblox currently has the majority of its revenue from paying users. To continue to grow, they must support the part of the community that continues to develop and update experiences to attract and retain users.

### comment: I think it's a good idea to use AI to make creating UGC easier! I'm sure many people have great ideas and creative minds and are bottlenecked by the actual creation process, and this should make it possible or at least easier for them to realize their ideas. - Jeffrey Chen (jzc719)
